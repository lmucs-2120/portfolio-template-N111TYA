How I earned my A in CMSI 2120 was by always trying my hardest to keep with the class. I always tried showing up to class, there have been countless of times when I show up and realize class was cancled or on zoom. I always gave my 100% to try to acheive an A in the class. I would constantly talk to my peers during and outside of this course just to make sure I'm on track with all due dates. I also choose an amazing friend to sit by who not only helped and explained many concepts when given a chance to but also kept me very orginozed when it came to any prior due dates. I think overall this class helped me form a balence between class and peers which are the most imporant factors when aiming for an A.

Dear future nitya <3,

I hope all is going well right now I know we always have lots on our plate. Life is very hard at times with all the obsticles it throws you one at time. I just want you to be in the present right now and admire all the beautiful things you have right now. It was very to create but you did it and can do anything else you set your mind to. Never stop beliveing in yourself, you will get everything you desire and more. Please never settle for less that will break you more than ever trying will. Don't give up even if your the last one standing! I love you and wish the best for you!!

Thank you for everything,

Nitya <3
