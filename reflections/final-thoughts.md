# Final thoughts

{% hint style="info" %}
What was this semester like for you (in CMSI 2120 and/or in general)?
{% endhint %}
I really enjoyed this class because there was not much pressure on the usaual grade part which I really apprecited. This way of learning gave me more time to focus on the material and retain parts that stand out to me. Learning on your own schedule is such an amazing way to teach your class. This not only takes the stress off of me but also allows me to form needed study habits without being told it. It teaches you real life skill which is sure important in college.

If you remember one thing from this class, what will it be and why?
{% endhint %}
I think something that I remember the most in this class is the daily questions that we would each have to answer. I know it's such a small random detail but I looked forward to it daily. It just brings us togther not only as a class but as a community as humans. Many of us don't interact with others a lot espically in big quanties so this activity got most of us out of comfort zone to be in each others precence to be awknologed. Everytime it my was turn to answer the question I would come up with the most me response because I wanted people to know who I am and what I stand for. If people like what I have to say they will attract to me, that's why I always try to be authentic.

What do you want to learn/do next?
{% endhint %}
What I really want to learn it to make the ideas in my head into a reality. I feel like my mind has been ozzing with ideas but since I have no idea how to gp about it I just let it rot. I actually want to make my dreams come into frution and starting anywhere is really the first step. My vision lies mostly in ai and vr which is a subject i'm not even close to fmailiar with. I thinking putting some of my time in that field will advance my works or just give me more of a blueprint. I'm focousing in that specified feild during my time at LMU so i think it will be amazing and I can't wait to see who I become.

Are there things you wish could have been different about this class?
{% endhint %}
Not really much, I know our teacher was going through a tough time with her own personal issues and she did the best possible in her condition. I truly apperite all her efforts and smiles even through all she was deaily. Teachers truly deserve the world because theynsacrifice so much for us to become these great leaders that they've always beleived in. This class was perfect I learned so much about data structures, my peers, and my teacher I truly couldn't as for a better expirence. I hopy my teacher is proud of herself because she's so strong and taught another amazing semester. Thank you millions I wish you the best of luck with all to come!!
