Behind the scenes of CMSI 2120... tell me another story.
{% endhint %}
Hmmm... behind the scenes well I guess since this happened today I broke up with my boyfriend. We weren't dating for that long but he was still the first person to try for me. I have a hard time connecting with people because of a lack in similar mindsets. I've just been working for myself for years and I see the world in the very energetic magnitude that has helped me completley chnage my life for the better. I've taught myself this at a young age and I've stuck to it ever since but it makes it hard for people to stay in my life because of this constant growth and need to better in balence with postivety and presence within. This is a big commitmet and something that took me years to come to state that will change in the following. I need someone on my wavelength if not I've learned it's an unfiar relathionship for both. My ex acknolewged this and wanted to be better for me and himself but there was just a lot and it shouldnt be working torwards this relationship but ultitmetly oneselfs. We both tried our best to make it last as long as we could but we're to young to be dealing with these problems. I'm sad but happy. I know what I have to do now for my well being it's just not easy but it's all that left.
