What have you been working on learning these weeks? How is it going?
{% endhint %}
These weeks I've been learning on how to code my first game on unity. I plan on creating a flappy bird themed game with new characters for a little twist on the classic. I want thi game to be inspired by the reptillion conspiercy I beilive. It's about the shap shifting reptiles figues that morph into famour powerful beings to commit their mission on earth. So I want to create a repptilion jumbing through the matrix themes poles to catch the cleberties it then morphs to for points. this is a lot becaus of course I want to make the craziest things. I'm watching a tutorial on youtbe for the base and then I will figure out all the other special effects. Wish me luck!!
