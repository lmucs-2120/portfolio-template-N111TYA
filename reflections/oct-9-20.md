What are you spending your dedicated CMSI 2120 energy on the most? Is this working well for you?
{% endhint %}
I think I'm spending most of my time trying to learn code. I've been practicing the pythos leetcodes and seeing the given material very closley. It's a big adjustment for me because I'm still not the most fmailiar with code but it is making me a stronger coder. Since I'm learning this one launguage it gives me confidenc to go about all the other launge i"m yet to learn.

If you were to assign yourself a letter grade (and/or meme and/or gif) to represent the quality of your work so far, what would it be?
{% endhint %}
B or B+ would be a fair grade to give myself right now that activley reprsents my growth.
{% hint style="info" %}

Why did you choose the above letter grade/meme/gif?
{% endhint %}
I think I would give myself a B+ or B just because I still haven't perfected anything I've learned. I've grasped a lot of material and practiced it daily but it's still not perfect. I'm on the road to learing which is why I would give myself that grade but as time goes on I know my skill will only get better just as the grade.
