Behind the scenes of CMSI 2120... tell me a story.
{% endhint %}

I'm going to tell the story of how I learned fashiom. I always loved clothes but it was hard for me to not be insecure ad wear the things I want. I grew up with this for most of my life till I learned spirituality and threw better concious came better life. I started liking myself more but negllecting my fashion for so long kind of made me lose that inpiration. I had thhis one friend who i grew immensily close with during covid. She knew how to sew and would always have the best fits. After spening lots of time togther we adpated one's traits and she guided me through clothes. We were a bit simila at first but through time I adapted my own style. If it wasnet for her encourments, confidence, and kindess I wouldn't be the person I am today. We arent as close anymore sadly but I still owe her the world she was the most inflential person in my life yet.
