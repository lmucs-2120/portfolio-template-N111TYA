What have you been working on learning these weeks? How is it going?
{% endhint %}
I've really been working on the leetcodes, tey are a big help for my individual growth. Everyday I try my best to do some that are at my pace. It's defenitley chaallenging at time when I'm alone but having the support of other classmates helps me keep going on. Leetscodes are a great way to do work and learn concpets without the pressure of failing. This nessicary method has made the most growth so far can't wait to see how much I will chnage by the end of the semester.
